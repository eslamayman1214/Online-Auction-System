# Online Auction System
 an online auction management system in which members (buyers and sellers) participate in the selling of items .
▪ The online site has members. System keeps track of member ID, e-mail, name,
password, delivery address, phone number, points and list of items.
▪ Items are described by an item number, category, starting bid price, the start date of
the auction process, its end date and status (sold/available) .
▪ Items to be sold are placed in the marketplace which means they are available.
▪ The system provides search via category only or both category and price .
▪ Auction operation (transaction) starts when a buyer chooses a specific item. He
sends a buying request for that item. If the buyer is willing to pay the specified
starting bid price, then he writes the item number only, else he writes the suggested
price too. If buyer and seller agree on a price, the transaction proceeds and the item
is no longer placed on the marketplace .
▪ The system keeps track of each category and the number of items sold during the
month of that category. The system generates a report of the top category in respect
of the monthly transactions.
▪ A member (buyer or seller) can record feedback regarding the transaction. Feedback
contains ID of the other member participating in the transaction (let’s call him
member x), a rating (1 to 5) and a comment. If rating is 3 or more, then a point is
added to member x.
